Game Rules:
There are 9 biscuits with value, whose range is 0-9 and start with 0. The player rolls a dice and add the point to 2 adjacent biscuits. If one biscuit's value grow to 9, the biscuit will "belong to" the player who just roll the dice and cannot be added value to any more. If the value is over 9, the biscuit's value will change to that modulo 10. Who get 5 biscuit first will win the game.
The game includes three modules: Man vs AI, Man vs Man and Infinite biscuits(Survive Mode).

Survive Mode:
Given one minute, player should get as many scores as possible before time runs out. The initial value of biscuit is a random number between 1 to 6.
If the value grow to 9, get 2 scores, add 2 seconds to timebar; If it grow to 16, score 3, add 3 sconds; If it grow to 10 or 11, minus 1 score, decrease 3 seconds in timebar.
If the situation mentioned above occurs, the value of biscuit will be set as a random number between 1 to 6. Otherwise, it will be set as former value modulo 10.
