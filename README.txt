Game Rules:
There are 9 biscuits with value, whose range is 0-9 and start with 0. The player rolls a dice and add the point to 2 adjacent biscuits. If one biscuit's value grow to 9, the biscuit will "belong to" the player who just roll the dice and cannot be added value to any more. If the value is over 9, the biscuit's value will change to that modulo 10. Who get 5 biscuit first will win the game.
The game includes three modules: Man vs AI, Man vs Man and Infinite biscuits.
